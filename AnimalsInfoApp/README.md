In my 3rd assignment I made a UI with 2 buttons and when one of them is clicked it redirects the user to 2 different views. Clicking the 'Watch video' button will open the animal's Wikipedia website. When the 'Go to the link' button is clicked, the program directs the user to the relevant video of the animal.

Screens:
